  <p id="title">ARTIST STATEMENT</p>
  <p id="text">
    I don’t think there was a time when I first started drawing. Everyone draws as a child. At some point, some of those children become uninterested or give up thinking they aren’t talented enough. My family always supported me and nurtured my interest in art. I'm always thankful for that. When I was younger, I was really interested in trees. I would draw trees big enough to fill up the paper that branched off in swirls and looped around themselves. As I got older, I became more interested in people and faces. I started drawing more profiles and portraits. Expressing subtle emotions was my main inspiration.
<br>
<br>
I liked to think that my history as an artist allows me to see beauty in everyday life. I want to broaden my view of beauty and I want to create something beautiful and new. I’m inspired by anything, but I focus mostly on animated objects. Sometimes I see a random pattern in my blankets and want to bring it to life. I like to tell stories with my work, whether they are obvious to the viewer or stories only I know.
<br>
<br>
An artist that really inspired me for a while is Dimitra Milan. She’s a painter that is actually younger than me, but she creates amazingly detailed artworks. She overlays different animals, faces, prints and colors that compliment each other harmoniously. It is like she is creating a new world with just one painting. The way she brings those different elements together is something I’ve always struggled to achieve. I have found through making art, that I tend to like creating new worlds. I’m constantly creating fictional worlds for my works to live in. I love creating and naming characters. Sometimes I’ll even write short stories along with my works.
<br>
<br>
For a while, I had a hard time calling myself an artist. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, painting and creating but when I compared myself to others I wondered if I should really be considered an artist. That is also the reason that I hesitated so much in pursuing this field. As I’ve grown older, I have gained a lot more confidence in myself and myself as an artist. I am very close with my family and I used to be very dependent on them. They are a great support system, but I often found myself leaning on them even when I didn’t need to. After moving away from them for the first time, I have become much more independent. I know my family will always be there to support me when I need it, however I also know that I am capable of supporting myself. Eventually, I want to get to a point where I can also support them. I know that may be a while from now, but that desire alone lets me feel like I’m in the right place. I believe now that the only person that can define me as an artist is myself.
