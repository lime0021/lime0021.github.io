  <p id="title">ARTIST STATEMENT</p>
  <p id="text">
    I don’t think there was a time when I first started drawing. Everyone draws as a child. At some point, some of those children become uninterested or give up thinking they aren’t talented enough. My family always supported me and nurtured my interest in art. I'm always thankful for that. When I was younger, I was really interested in trees. I would draw trees big enough to fill up the paper that branched off in swirls and looped around  themselves. As I got older, I became more interested in people and faces. I started drawing more profiles and portraits. Expressing subtle emotions was my main inspiration.
<br>
<br>
I liked to think that my history as an artist allows me to see beauty in everyday life. I want to broaden my view of beauty and I want to create something beautiful and new. I’m inspired by anything, but I focus mostly on animated objects. Sometimes I see a random pattern in my blankets and want to bring it to life. I like to tell stories with my work, whether they are obvious to the viewer or stories only I know. I enjoy incorporating humour or expressing emotion. 
<br>
<br>
An artist that really inspired me for a while is Dimitra Milan. She’s a painter that is actually younger than me, but she creates amazingly detailed artworks. She overlays different animals, faces, prints and colors that compliment each other harmoniously. It is like she is creating a new world with just one painting. The way she brings those different elements together is something I’ve always struggled to achieve.  
<br>
<br>
For a while, I had a hard time calling myself an artist. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, painting and creating but when I compared myself to others I wondered if I should really be considered an artist. I believe now that the only person that can define me as an artist is myself.
