  <p id="title">BIO</p>
   <p id="text">I started off as a traditional artist. I worked with mostly pens and pencils, drawing on sheets of paper. I would sometimes venture out into painting, but I rarely took the time because it always seemed like a hassle to clean up. In my senior year of high school I took an art class. A majority of the curriculum was familiar and I didn’t feel challenged. The class felt like a break, and that wasn’t a bad thing at the time. I took my second art class in community college. It was an intro to drawing class. Though it was a bit more challenging due to the increased resources, it still felt like I wasn’t learning much. Around that time, I started focusing more on math and sciences and chose to follow a path in computer science. My artistic outflux decreased and I worked hard to get into SJSU. After my first semester on the San Jose campus, I decided computer science was not for me. I transferred to the DMA program because it seemed like the closest switch. At this point, I had very little experience with this medium. In my mind it was still art and that was all that mattered. Digital art was new and challenging and I enjoyed experimenting with each new program or technology I worked with. I still love drawing and illustrating on paper just as much as I do on a tablet. DMA has broadened my horizons and how I imagined art could be produced.

  <p id="title">ARTIST STATEMENT</p>
  <p id="text">
When people call me an artist, the always ask me when I started drawing. Everyone draws as a child so I tell them, I just never stopped drawing. My family always supported me and nurtured my interest in art. When I was younger, I was really interested in trees. I would draw trees big enough to fill up the paper that branched off in swirls and looped around themselves. As I got older, I became more interested in people and faces. I started drawing more profiles and portraits. Expressing emotions was my main inspiration. I want to create works that people can feel.

<br>
Sometimes I see a random pattern in my blankets and want to bring it to life. I like to tell stories with my work, whether they are obvious to the viewer or stories only I know. I’m constantly creating fictional worlds for my works to live in. I love creating and naming characters. Sometimes I’ll even write short stories along with my works.
<br>
<br>
For a while, I had a hard time calling myself an artist. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, painting and creating, but I always considered it a hobby. I was nervous to chose my passion and fail. When I compared myself to others I wondered if I should really be considered an artist. I hesitated so much in pursuing this field. As I’ve grown older, I have gained a lot more confidence in myself as an individual and as an artist. I believe now that the only person that can define me as an artist is myself. When people call me an artist, they tell me I should do something with it. Now I tell them, “Yep! I am.”
